# Creative Coding Hackspace
--- 
The huddersfield Creative Coding Hackspace is an informal weekly session held within the University of Huddersfield. Creative Coders of all levels of experience and disciplines are welcome to attend with the three shared goals in mind.

1. _Motivate_ each other and share work periodically to get feedback and help or ask for constructive criticism

2. _Share_ ideas or knowledge that you think may benefit or others or enrich the work of others with new perspectives

3. _Sustain_ the collaborative spirit of creative coding with the University and generate a sense of community

So far we have people from a number of backgrounds who are working with a number of technologies. For example: 

- ReaScript
- SuperCollider
- Max
- js
- Visualisation
- Machine Learning
- Python
- Audio Decomposition
- Architecture of Patches and Text-Based Code
- Version Control Crash Course
- Raspberry Pi/Arduino/Embedded
- Video Art
- Kinetc Sculptures

We currently meet in **OA5/13** at the University on **Fridays** from **2pm - 5pm**. 

Any questions can be forwarded to the admin. james.bradbury(at)hud.ac.uk
