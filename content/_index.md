# Creative Coding Hackspace
--- 
The huddersfield Creative Coding Hackspace is an informal weekly session held within the University of Huddersfield. Creative Coders of all levels of experience and disciplines are welcome to attend with the three shared goals in mind.


1. _Motivate_ each other and share work periodically to get feedback and help or ask for constructive criticism

2. _Share_ ideas or knowledge that you think may benefit or others or enrich the work of others with new perspectives

3. _Sustain_ the collaborative spirit of creative coding with the University and generate a sense of community


<!-- So far we have people from a number of backgrounds who are working with a number of technologies and in several areas of interest. For example: 

- ReaScript
- SuperCollider
- Max
- js
- Visualisation
- Machine Learning
- Python
- Audio decomposition
- Architecture of Max patches versus text-based code
- Version control
- Raspberry Pi/Arduino/Embedded
- Kinetc sculptures -->

This website acts as form of documentation for what happens in the hackspace and a way for people to formally communicate what they learn in the hope that others can learn from this too.

We currently meet in **G/01** at the University on **Fridays** from **2pm - 5pm**.

Any questions can be forwarded to the admin hackspace(at)jamesbradbury.net
