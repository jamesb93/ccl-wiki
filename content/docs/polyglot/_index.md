# dsp-polyglot

### The [rosetta code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) is a wiki-like resource that documents solutions to programming challenges across a vast array of languages. Some creative coders from Huddersfield took inspiration from this and wanted to make a similar resource for demonstrating solutions to problems in the audio domain, perhaps bringing languages dedicated to these tasks conceptually in-line with other 'mainstream' languages as well as providing a repository of solutions that others could benefit from.
