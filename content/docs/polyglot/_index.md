# dsp-polyglot

The [rosetta code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) is a wiki-like resource that documents solutions to programming challenges across a vast number of languages. Some creative coders from Huddersfield took inspiration from this and wanted to make a similar resource that could be dedicated to solving common DSP problems, perhaps bringing languages dedicated to these tasks conceptually in-line with other 'mainstream' languages as well as providing a repository of solutions to problems.
