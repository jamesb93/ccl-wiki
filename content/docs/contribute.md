This website is essentially a collection of Markdown (.md) files that are rendered into a static site by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)

If you clone the repository from [here](https://github.com/jamesb93/creative-coding-hackspace) and look in the `/content/` directory you will see that there are two folders `posts` and `docs`. `docs` contains the pages that don't change like people and projects. The `posts` directory contains a markdown file per post. For example, the first post _ever_ `version-control.md` is a good template for creating your own article. You could start by duplicating this file and then editing the copy with your own content. Once that's complete you can submit a pull request or send the markdown file via e-mail to the either [James](mailto:james.b@posteo.me) or [Jacob](mailto:jacob.hart@gmail.com) who will integrate it into the website.
