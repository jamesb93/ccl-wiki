# Creative Coding Lab
---

The Creative Coding Lab is part of the Centre for Research in New Music (CeReNeM) at the University of Huddersfield. It is an international research hub for audio software research, led by Dr Alex Harker and linked to Dr Hyunkook Lee's Applied Psychoacoustics Lab within the School of Computing and Engineering. The CCL focuses on software programming for creative purposes, with current projects covering applied psychoacoustics, 3D spatialisation, interactive analysis, large database navigation and resynthesis, and creative DSP tools. The aim of the CCL is to produce high-quality research that leads to new open-source software tools, and to enable the further development of these tools through relationships with the lab’s industry partners.

Key to the concept of the ‘laboratory’ of the CCL is an enhanced integration between postgraduate students and staff, providing a mixed model of funded study and paid work on staff projects for exceptionally promising student programmers. The other central focus is interdisciplinary exchange, drawing on the technical expertise and creative user base of the internationally renowned practitioners within CeReNeM’s network to create innovative software tools. Knowledge transfer inside and outside of the university—including work with international partners and industry consultants—is crucial in this process, drawing on existing partnerships as well as supporting new relationships with high-profile institutions.

This wiki/website/repository is a place to collect, store and provide a means for discovering the work that the CCL produces as well as giving a collective identity to the members past and present.
